	<h1>Our Beliefs</h1>
    
	<h2>God</h2>
  <p>There is only one true and living God, and He exists in 3 persons. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. All three are equal and have always existed.</p>
  
<ul>
  	<li><strong>The Father</strong> &mdash; He is all powerful, all knowing and all loving.</li>
    <li><strong>Jesus Christ</strong> &mdash; The Son of God and equal with the Father. Took the form of man, lived a sinless life and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of every man, woman and child. He died on a cross, rose again in three days and is seated at the right hand of the Father. Only by the shedding of His blood is there forgiveness of sin, and entrance to heaven.</li>
    <li><strong>The Holy Spirit</strong> &mdash; The third Person of the Trinity. He guides us into all truth, exalts Christ, convicts of sin, righteousness and judgment. He is the comforter and giver of gifts. He is ever present in the lives of unbelievers to empower them to live the Christian life.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Scripture</h2>
	<p>The Word of God was written by humans inspired by God. We believe that the bible is absolute truth from cover to cover, and given to us by God so that we may know Him, and His will for our lives.</p>

	<h2>Giving To The Church</h2>        
	<p>	We believe that we are to give a tithe, or a tenth of our gross income to the local church or &ldquo;storehouse&rdquo;. We are to give cheerfully, regularly and liberally for the advancement of the Kingdom of God.</p>

	<h2>Humans</h2>
	<p>We believe that we are made in the image of God. However, because of sin, we are separated from God in pride, lusts and disobedience. With salvation through Christ, we are &ldquo;born again&rdquo; with a new nature that desires to please our heavenly Father.</p>

	<h2>Evangelism</h2>
	<p>We believe that it&rsquo;s the duty of every Christian to share the good news of salvation in Jesus. It is a command of Christ, and one we take very seriously.</p>

	<h2>The Church</h2>
	<p>The church is not a building, but a gathering of local believers who are associated by their common faith and fellowship in Jesus Christ. The church is to extend the gospel to the ends of the earth. </p>

	<h2>Ordinances</h2>
	<p><strong>Baptism</strong> by full emersion is the first act of obedience for any Christian. Its an outward expression of the inward work of God in our lives. </p>
	
	<p><strong>Lords Supper</strong> â€“ The Lord&rsquo;s supper is a symbolic act where believers remember the death and &ldquo;resurrection&rdquo; of the Lord Jesus Christ and anticipate His return. The wine is symbolic of His blood being spilled for us, and the bread represents His body.</p>
